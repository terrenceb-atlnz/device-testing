description: How to run the AWPTCM DoS suite (T5437-5442) on the tb470 IE520 bench — transit traffic, batched senders, disarm syntax; ipoptions UNRESOLVED (the 'needs L3' claim is unproven)

`claude/device-testing/IE520/dos/DOS-METHOD.md` is the full method + per-case logs (5437-5442),
produced 2026-09-03. Attack source = tb470 eth3 (scapy tools in
`raw-data/test_scripts/tools/denial_of_service/`), DUT = IE520 port1.0.1, transit victim = x230.

Four non-obvious points that each cost a failed attempt:

1. **Send TRANSIT traffic** — dst = a host BEHIND the switch (x230 `10.38.215.71` /
   `00:1a:eb:91:cc:a1`), NOT the switch's own MAC. Frames to the switch's own MAC are
   CPU-punted and bypass the ingress DoS ASIC → 0 detections.
2. **Batch the sends** — the stock tools' single-packet `sendp(pkt, loop=1)` is too slow to
   cross the DoS rate threshold. Use a looped/repeated batch (`sendp([pkt]*2000)`). teardrop.py
   works out-of-the-box ONLY because it happens to send a 12-packet list.

The whole suite is now one version-tracked tool:
`claude/Test-cases/ask-ck/test-composer/dos_campaign.py` — build-up → all six cases → teardown
in a `finally`; run AS ROOT on tb470 (`sudo -n PYTHONPATH=/home/st-art python3 dos_campaign.py
[case ...]`). It polls the port back to `connected` before each attack + retries once, so it is
robust to the err-disable-recovery timing flake.
3. **Disarm is `no dos <type>`** (for smurf `no dos smurf`, dropping the `broadcast A.B.C.D`),
   NOT `no dos <type> action shutdown` — the latter is accepted but leaves detection enabled.
   Recover an err-disabled port with `no shutdown`.
4. **`dos ipoptions` needs the L3/ROUTED path** — IP options are parsed only on routing, so on
   the flat-L2 (bridged, non-routing) bench it never fires even with valid LSRR/RR options at
   rate. Verdict: teardrop/land/ping-of-death/smurf/synflood PASS; ipoptions config-verified
   only, needs a routed topology to exercise.
   **⚠ 2026-09-28: UNPROVEN.** The packets behind this claim used an ILLEGAL multicast source
   MAC (`01:00:01:00:00:01`) that the devices drop anyway (`dos/routed-ipoptions-2026-09-04/
   BOOKMARK.md`). Craft DoS frames with a valid unicast source MAC; whether `dos ipoptions`
   counts is still unanswered (5437 inconclusive).

Pass criterion: armed+attack → port `err-disable` (`show dos interface`, Attacks detected > 0);
disarmed+attack → port stays connected.
