While reproducing bootloader menu behaviour on tb470 u4, I drove the Boot Menu by trial and
error — guessing bare-keypress vs `\r`, guessing prompt defaults — and burned several hardware
cycles plus a wrong result (accidentally triggering YMODEM instead of TFTP). Terrence:

> executions, which literally tell you what to expect at every menu?"*

He was right. Everything I "discovered" was already written down in two places I had open:

1. **The framework source** — `ATBootLoader.py::perform_one_off_boot_from_alternate_source_with_output()`
   encodes the exact sequence: `send('1')` bare for menu options, `send(options[source])` bare for
   the media choice, `send('{}\r\n'.format(selection))` **with** `\r\n` for the file selection,
   plus the literal gate keyword lists. `runRestoreFactorySettings()` likewise does
   `dut.send('7', ...)` then `dut.send('y', ...)` — both bare.
2. **The prior run transcripts** — `swi_a_*.log` are full console captures of the framework
   driving these same menus end to end, prompt by prompt.

**Why it matters:** hardware cycles are slow (a reboot + 44 MB TFTP load is minutes), each blind
keystroke can land on the wrong menu item, and a stray character can select something destructive.
I typed `x540-tb470.rel` into a device menu and the `4` in it selected **YMODEM**, which then hung
until it timed out. Guessing on hardware is not cheap and is not safe.

**How to apply:** before driving any interactive device menu, read the framework function that
already automates it and the prior `swi_a_*.log` for the same case. Extract the send/expect pairs
from those, then replicate. Probe the device only for what genuinely is not recorded anywhere.
Same instinct as [[checks-must-not-match-their-own-advice]] and the divergence-vs-rot rule in
[[x230v2-5700-control-corpus]]: the corpus answers the question before the hardware does.

**The specific facts I should have read rather than rediscovered** (IE520 Boot Menu):
- Menu options and Y/N confirmations take a **bare keypress**; a trailing `\r` leaks into the
  *next* prompt. `7\r` selects "Restore Bootloader factory settings" and then immediately answers
  its own "Are you sure? (Y/N)" as no.
- Only the file-selection prompt takes Enter — it says so: *"press enter"*.
- Top-level Boot Menu `0` is **RESTART**, not "back" — see [[ie520-bootloader-console-driving]].

## 2026-08-26 — the same mistake, one layer down: I INVENTED a CLI command

Chasing a core file after the 38378 cycle-293 master wedge, I wanted member 1's own
`debug:` filesystem. I typed **`remote-command 1 dir debug:`** at the stack master. No such
command exists — the device answered `% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.` Terrence:

> *"Review the CLI commands that we have in the ck database, thats definitely not one of
> them that i know"*

He was right, and the reference had the answer the whole time. One query settled it:

```bash
sqlite3 'file:ask-ck/db/ck.db?mode=ro' "SELECT DISTINCT command, syntax FROM cli_commands WHERE command LIKE 'remote%';"
# read-only URI: never open the live ck.db read-write while the server runs ([[stale-session-connection-bug]])
```

- **`remote-command`** — does not exist anywhere in ck.db. I made it up from plausibility.
- **`remote-login <stack-ID>`** — real (page name `remotelogin`), Privileged Exec, `exit`
  returns to the master. That was the command I actually needed.

**How to apply:** before sending any command to hardware that you have not just read in
ck.db, the framework source, or a prior run log, **grep ck.db for it**. `cli_commands` is
keyed on `command` with a `syntax` array and a `notes` JSON blob (Mode / Usage notes /
Example). Checking costs one query; guessing costs a hardware round trip and puts an
unknown string on a console that may be mid-test.

Two follow-on facts learned the same way (both from the device, after checking):
- `remote-login` lands in **user exec** (`awplus-1>`) — `dir` needs `enable` first.
- A backup member cannot copy to a remote filesystem: *"% Copying to/from remote file
  systems is only supported from the stack master"*. Two-step it — `copy debug:/x flash:/x`
  on the member, then `copy awplus-1/flash:/x tftp://...` from the master.

Same lesson as the section above, and as [[generator-cli-hallucination]] /
[[cli-fabrication-originates-step2]]: **fabricated CLI is not a generator-only failure
mode — I do it too, and at a live console it is more expensive.**
