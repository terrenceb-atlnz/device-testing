**The mechanics now live in `platforms/IE520.md` §2** (moved from orient-dt §3, 2026-10-02) — bootloader-menu
keypress conventions (menu options and Y/N take a *bare* keypress; only file selection takes
Enter, and AW+ CLI `(y/n)` wants `y\r`), the `Ctrl+B` rule, and the unconditional `finally:` (state-driven since 2026-10-02:
main-menu `0` is Restart, and `9` in `Select device` saves the boot source). Read it there; do not restate it here.

**Provenance, which is why this file still exists.** Terrence caught a script parked in the boot
menu on tb470 `u5`, 2026-08-10, before I did — a scripted `Ctrl+B` tick that never stopped, so
the menu re-printed forever, the read loop never settled, and the unit was left offline to
everyone else.

**Why it was emptied, 2026-09-02.** This file also asserted *"neither tb470 IE520 is on the
PDU, so there is no remote power-cycle recovery"* — a **bench** fact in a **mechanics** memory,
with nothing to invalidate it when the bench changed. It was wrong by 2026-08-13 and stayed
here three weeks, and it had been used to justify making the `finally:` conditional. Measured
2026-09-02 through the framework's own power path: `(10.36.150.14, 4): status is ON`.

The rule that came out of it, and the reason this is a `feedback` memory rather than a deleted
file: **bench facts belong in `bench-state.md`, operating mechanics in the orient skill, and a
memory should carry a pointer plus the provenance — never a third copy.**
See [[tb470-topology-and-setup]] for the same treatment.
