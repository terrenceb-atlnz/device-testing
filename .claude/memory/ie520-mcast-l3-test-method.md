Method proven 2026-09-09 running AWPTCM multicast + directed-broadcast cases on tb470
(logs: `device-testing/IE520/switching/{38135,38136,38137,38425,38422,38423,38424,5519,5520}.log`).

> **STALE TOPOLOGY WARNING (2026-09-22): the u4/u5 fabric below NO LONGER EXISTS.** The bench
> was rebuilt on 2026-09-18 (4-member stack + AR4050S) and again on 2026-09-21 (x230 added on
> `/dev/u0`). The METHOD and the seven gotchas below are still correct and still cost real
> debugging; the PORT NAMES are not. Current layout and its limits:
> [[tb470-bench-structural-limits]]. Today the path is
> `tb470 eth2 -> DUT port2.0.2` in, `DUT port1.0.2 -> x230 -> tb470 eth1` out.
>
> **NEW GOTCHA 8, and it invalidated a first pass:** the observation path now runs THROUGH the
> x230, which has its own IGMP/MLD snooping enabled by default. Snooping cases first read
> `1/10` with DUT snooping DISABLED — the DUT was flooding correctly and the **x230 was pruning
> it downstream**. Disable snooping on the x230 for these cases and restore it after. Generally:
> **the x230 is a switch in the path, not a wire** — ask what it does to any measurement.
>
> **NEW GOTCHA 9:** with snooping ENABLED the first frame of a new group still floods while the
> entry installs — `1/10` then `0/10, 0/10` on repeat bursts. Do not grade "enabled" as
> requiring exactly 0.

**The binding constraint on this bench:** only ONE usable host NIC on the u4/u5 fabric —
`tb eth2 -> u4 port1.0.2`. `eth1 -> u2` is a dead-end (u2 has 0 LLDP neighbours; its only
fabric cabling was the RX-faulty ring ports). u5 has NO host NIC. Fabric = host—u4—[2 links]—u5,
no loopback plugs, no spare cabled ports. So a second HOST capture port is impossible.

**The working pattern (no hairpin needed):**
- DUT/querier = **u4**; multicast **SOURCE = u5's CLI `ping`**; **RECEIVER = the tb470 host**
  (real scapy-crafted IGMP/MLD reports, receipt counted by tcpdump). Source and receiver are
  then genuinely different ports on different devices.
- Loop-safety: run one vlan10 trunk `u4 port1.0.24 <-> u5 port2.0.24` and **shut the 2nd link
  port*.0.26** (RSTP is disabled on these units; don't rely on loop-protection).
- Driver = `console.py` (md5 af85058…) via `/tmp/ckorient/*.py` (tmpfs, not the lab tree).

**Gotchas that each cost a debug cycle:**
1. **IGMP source-address check** is ON by default (`show ip igmp interface` → "Source Address
   checking is enabled"). scapy `sendp` sets IP.src=0.0.0.0 → the report is silently dropped
   and the group never registers. **Set IP.src to a real on-subnet host IP** in the report.
2. scapy IGMP needs `pkt[IGMP].igmpize()` (scapy 2.6, no args) to get a valid checksum +
   router-alert + TTL 1. MLDv1/v2 classes are in `scapy.all` (ICMPv6MLReport/MLDone/
   MLReport2/MLDMultAddrRec); MLD reports source from the host **link-local**.
3. A switch (u5) only sources multicast if it has **`ip[v6] multicast-routing`** — else
   `ping <group>` has no route and never hits the wire. IPv4: `ping <grp> source <svi-ip>`.
   **IPv6 `ping ipv6` syntax = `ping ipv6 <grp> interface vlan10 repeat N`** (interface BEFORE
   repeat; NO `source`, NO `interval` keyword).
4. To make `show ip igmp groups` / `show ipv6 mld groups` populate (what the cases check),
   enable full L3 **`ip igmp` / `ipv6 mld`** on the DUT SVI, not just snooping-querier.
5. `show platform table ipmulti` stays at its baseline 224.0.0.0/24 link entry for same-VLAN
   tests — the group is L2-bridged by snooping, NOT an L3 (S,G) mroute. Don't call that a fail.
6. Leave residue: IGMPv2/v3 leave clears `show...groups` immediately (1 in-flight frame). MLD
   Done clears L3 state at once but the **L2 snooping entry ages out over the last-member
   window** (no fast-leave) → a few residual frames; that's correct, not a defect. IGMPv1 has
   **no leave at all** — group persists until querier group-timeout.
7. **Directed-broadcast tests need FULLY-TAGGED host subinterfaces** (`eth2.<vid>`), not a
   trunk native-vlan: native-vlan untagged broke the vlan10 path here. `ip directed-broadcast`
   goes on the DUT's *egress/target* SVI; disabled = dropped (good control). Remote/off-link
   case: source from a 2nd router (u5) whose off-link subnet SVI is up (add that vlan to an
   up trunk port so the SVI comes up), routed over a /30 transit to the DUT.

**Port-authentication cases (auth-mac / web-auth), added 2026-09-09** (logs:
`device-testing/IE520/authentication/{30142,19223}.log`):
- Use the IE520's **on-box local RADIUS** — no external server: `radius-server local` /
  `server enable` / `nas 127.0.0.1 key K`; `radius-server host 127.0.0.1 key K`;
  `aaa authentication {auth-mac|auth-web|dot1x} default group radius`. (dot1x accepts only a
  RADIUS group — **802.1X-via-TACACS+ is not an AW+ capability**.)
- **auth-mac**: the MAC-auth username the switch sends defaults to hyphen-lowercase
  (`00-f0-4d-00-77-17`); the exact string is in `show radius local-server statistics` →
  "Users NOT present". Register it as `user <mac> password <mac>` to authorise. Unauthenticated
  state: `show auth interface` → `portStatus: Unauthorized`, `packetForwarding: none`; prove the
  block by the peer switch (u5) never learning the MAC / no ARP, and pings 100% loss.
- **web-auth**: `auth-web enable` + `auth-web-server ipaddress <svi>`. Drive it headless with
  curl: unauth HTTP returns `307 -> http://<svi>/`; the portal form POSTs to
  `http://<svi>/index.cgi` with `USERNAME`/`PASSWORD`/`ACTION=login`. On success
  `show auth interface` → `portStatus: Authorized`.
- **Internal DHCP server**: `service dhcp-server` + `ip dhcp pool` (`network`, `range`,
  `default-router`, `lease`); web-auth permits DHCP pre-auth. Test it with a scapy
  Discover/Request (keeps the host's own routing untouched); confirm `show ip dhcp binding`.
- Guest-vlan L3 forwarding cases (T28126-129) need **two supplicant ports + line rate** →
  not doable on this one-host-NIC bench; VCS/tri-auth needs a working 2-member stack.

**L3 routing cases (PIM-SM/SSM, static mroute, VRRP), added 2026-09-10** (logs:
`device-testing/IE520/ipv4-routing/{7741,11405,11402,11762,11773,30403,18945}.log`):
- **Daemons are `service`-gated, NOT licence-gated** — see [[awplus-service-gated-routing-daemons]].
  `service pim|ospf|rip|vrrp` starts the daemon LIVE (no reboot); then `ip pim sparse-mode`,
  `router ospf`, `router vrrp` are accepted. u4/u5 lack AT-IE520-FL01 yet run all of it.
- **PIM-SM single-box fabric that works reliably:** u4 = RP (`ip pim rp-address <lo>`) + FHR +
  LHR; host tagged sub-ifs are the source (one vlan) and receivers (other vlans); `ip igmp` +
  `ip pim sparse-mode` on every SVI. mroute oif-list = the joined vlans exactly (that IS the
  "no leakage" proof). SPT bit sets after the RP-tree join. HSL "Entry exists" error must be absent.
- **PIM-SSM:** `access-list 40 permit <range> <wild>` + `ip pim ssm range 40`. Receiver join =
  scapy IGMPv3 CHANGE_TO_INCLUDE (rtype=3, srcaddrs=[S]) to 224.0.0.22, RA option, on-subnet src
  → `show ip igmp groups <G> detail` shows Include-mode + source list. In-range: source-specific
  (unjoined source hits an empty-oif (S,G) → dropped). Out-of-range (*,G) EXCLUDE join builds an
  RP shared tree (ASM); in-range (*,G) builds NO shared tree → arbitrary source dropped. That
  ASM-in/out contrast is the clean SSM-range discriminator.
- **Static mroute (`ip mroute <src/mask> <rpf-addr>`):** only load-bearing for a REMOTE source
  with NO unicast route (remove the unicast route first). Verify with `show ip rpf <src>` →
  "RPF type: static"; removed → "failed, no route exists". Working method WITHOUT relying on a
  switch as source: inject the source on the transit vlan (host eth2.<transit>, spoofed src) whose
  RPF neighbour IS a real PIM router (u5) — u4 then RPF-accepts on that vlan and forwards. A
  phantom source whose RPF neighbour is a host does NOT forward (no PIM adjacency). A switch
  `ping <grp>` as a PIM SOURCE does not register cleanly, and `ip igmp static-group <G> source <S>`
  registers the IGMP membership but does NOT trigger a PIM SSM (S,G) join.
- **VRRP:** `router vrrp <vrid> <ifname>` / `virtual-ip <ip> [master|backup|owner]` (VIP MUST be
  inside the SVI subnet, else "Init - no matching subnet") / `priority` / `preempt-mode true` /
  `enable`; disable the instance with `disable`. VMAC = 00:00:5e:00:01:VRID. Graceful `disable`
  fails over in ~1 probe interval (<<1s); measure by 50 pps ICMP to the VIP with `ping -D`,
  correlate the outage gap to the wall-clock epoch of the disable/enable (an uncorrelated gap can
  be a warm-up artefact — the first cold failover showed 3.1s, precise correlation showed 20ms).
- **CONSOLE COLLISION:** only ONE accessor per /dev/uN. A backgrounded `drv.py` (e.g. a source
  `ping`) HOLDS that console — a second query to the same unit gets "device disconnected / multiple
  access" and returns nothing. Put the source on the HOST (or the unit you don't need to observe).
  `fuser -k /dev/ttyUSBx` frees a stuck console; a unit left in `config-if` needs `end` (the
  driver's login terminal-setup fails there, making every command read as "^ % Invalid input").

**PIM-SM multicast + full-table stack MASTER failover (T11427), added 2026-09-11** (log:
`device-testing/IE520/ipv4-routing/11427.log`):
- **Result:** multicast across a stack **master** failover is **loss-free** — 50 pps stream saw
  max inter-arrival gap 0.0204–0.0216 s (= normal cadence, no dropped frame) over TWO
  `reload stack-member <master>` events, with 300 OSPF routes in the stack FIB throughout. Stronger
  than T10623's unicast ~2 s: multicast has **no host-ARP-to-gateway** dependency, so with the
  forwarding path + `stack virtual-mac` held on the SURVIVING member the data plane never drops.
- **Topology:** stack = RP (loopback `ip pim rp-address`) + FHR (host source on a stack SVI); a
  standalone (u4) = LHR (host receiver on its SVI); PIM adjacent over the vlan10 transit; RP + source
  subnet advertised into OSPF so the LHR can RPF. `service pim` + `ip multicast-routing` on both.
- **The star forces the survivor.** Only stack member 1 has ACTIVE inter-switch links (member 2's are
  admin-shut for loop-freeness), so the survivor MUST be member 1 → to measure a MASTER failover you
  first move mastership to member 2 (`reload stack-member 1`, wait full rejoin — poll `show stack`
  for both `Ready` + `Normal operation`), THEN `reload stack-member 2`. The re-position itself is a
  member-1 outage (path down while it reboots), not a continuity number.
- **Full table:** N statics on the LHR (`ip route <p>/24 <blackhole-nexthop>`) + `redistribute
  static` under `router ospf` → stack learns N OSPF externals (300 → FIB 300). Survives the failover
  (synced to backup, no relearn); OSPF re-syncs the neighbour ~17–19 s later, ExStart dip, never Down.
- **Host RX gotchas (each cost a cycle):** (1) `IGMP` is in **`scapy.contrib.igmp`**, NOT
  `scapy.all` — wrong import silently sends no join. (2) The receiver NIC needs
  **`ip link set dev ethN allmulticast on`** AND **`rp_filter=0`** (real path `/proc/.../conf/ethN.<vid>/rp_filter`;
  the `ethN/<vid>` sysctl name doesn't map) — else the host SOCKET drops cross-interface multicast
  though frames reach the wire (tcpdump in promisc sees them). (3) Cleanest receiver: a **kernel IGMP
  join** (UDP socket `IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP` grp+local_ip) to hold membership + **`tcpdump -tt`** to
  record arrivals; the gap in epochs = the outage. Source = unprivileged UDP `SOCK_DGRAM` (no root).
- **Restore = reboot from unsaved startup** (nothing `write`-saved → plain `reload` returns baseline).
