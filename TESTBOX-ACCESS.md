# Testbox Access & Script Execution (from this host)

How to SSH to a lab testbox from this development host, drive a switch's CLI console, and
run an ATTestSet framework test script on hardware. Grounded in what actually works from
this machine (verified 2026-07-28) plus the mechanism the PyTest Creator uses
(`ask-ck/CK-main/CK_server/pt_exec.py`).

## TL;DR — reconnect to tb105 now

```bash
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/1971/keyring/ssh ssh tb105
#   then, in the interactive shell on tb105:
u5                       # = minicom --wrap -D /dev/u5  → the x950 stack console
#   Ctrl-A then Q to leave minicom without resetting the port.
```

For automation (minicom needs a TTY, so it can't be driven by one-shot SSH commands), drive
the same serial port with **pyserial on tb105** — see §2.

---

## 0. The one gotcha: SSH auth from this host ✅

This host is a Mac-attached VS Code Remote-SSH session; `git`/`ssh` actually run on the
Linux host, but the **default `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` points at the forwarded Mac agent, which is
empty** — so a plain `ssh tb105` fails `Permission denied (publickey)`. The on-disk
`~/.ssh/id_rsa` is passphrase-encrypted (useless non-interactively). The **working key lives
in the Linux gnome-keyring agent**:

```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/1971}/keyring/ssh"   # = /run/user/1971/keyring/ssh
ssh-add -l        # → 2048 SHA256:ob3X… terrenceb@terrenceb-dl (RSA)
```

`~/.bashrc` exports this for **interactive** shells, so a normal terminal `ssh tb105` just
works. **Non-interactive / tool shells must set `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` explicitly.** This is the same
key that authenticates GitHub — for Terrence's own `git push`; Claude does not push from this
seat (company-set permissions deny it), it commits and reports the hashes.

---

## 1. SSH to a testbox ✅

Testboxes resolve by short name on the lab DNS; the connection is direct (no jump host):

```bash
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/1971/keyring/ssh ssh tb105
```

| Fact (tb105) | Value |
|---|---|
| resolves to | `10.36.200.105`, port 22 (OPEN) ✅ |
| login user | `terrenceb` (from `ssh -G tb105`) |
| the device it fronts | an **8-member x950 stack** 📄 |
| mgmt path | tb105 `eth2` `10.37.105.100/25` ↔ stack `eth0` `10.37.105.6/25` (shared mgmt LAN, no data-plane link) 📄 |

Generalises to any box: `SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$sock ssh tb<NNN>`. `ssh -G tb<NNN>` shows the
resolved host/user without connecting.

---

## 2. Drive a switch's CLI console (for CLI grounding / verifying real output)

On tb105 the stack console is a USB serial port: **`/dev/u5 -> /dev/ttyUSB20`** ✅
(`crw-rw---- root grp_everyone` — group-readable, so it's **shared**; don't collide with
another operator).

### Which console is which unit — verify, do NOT trust the `.setup` ✅

The `.setup` file is **declarative, not verified**. Its `[switch] = /dev/uN` lines rot as lab
hardware is recabled, and a stale line will point you at a different device entirely. Measured
on tb105, 2026-07-29: `tb105.setup` declared the 8-member `c2_core_stk` x950 stack on
`u16, u10, u24, u5, u17, u23, u6, u18`, but live only **3 of 8** were right — `u16/u17/u18`
fronted **C1-x930-STK**, `u23` fronted **D1-x540-STK-2**, and `u24` did not exist at all.

Parse `.setup` for membership / stackports / cabling (see `SETUP-FILE-REFERENCE.md`), but
resolve consoles against the hardware before driving anything.

**The reliable per-unit identifier is the login BANNER, not the prompt.** On an AlliedWare Plus
VCStack, every member's console serves the full stack-wide CLI and shows the *shared* stack
hostname once logged in (`x950-MAX#` on master and backups alike) — so the prompt cannot tell
you which unit you are on. The banner shows the unit's own name:

| What you see | Means |
|---|---|
| `x950-MAX-5 login:` | member **5** (the `-N` suffix is the stack ID) |
| `x950-MAX login:` (bare, no suffix) | the **Active Master** |
| `x950-MAX#` prompt, no banner | already logged in — identity unknown, send `quit` to force the banner |

That `quit`-to-read-the-banner trick is exactly what `0009_simple_repeated_Master_reboot.py::
get_master_id()` does. Note it **logs out whoever is on that console**.

Sweep **all** of `/dev/u*`, not just the subset `.setup` names — open each at 115200, send `\r`,
read, and match `([\w.-]+) login:`. Skip ports held by another operator (`/var/lock/LCK..*`,
`pgrep minicom`). **42** `/dev/uNN` ports on tb105 as at 2026-07-30 (`u24` does not exist; filter the
glob so `/dev/urandom` is not swept), budget ~2 s each — the whole sweep is ~90 s. Send only `\r` on
the first pass: that identifies anything sitting at a login prompt without disturbing it, and leaves
`quit` (which logs the occupant out) for just the consoles you actually need.

**tb105 `c2_core_stk` (`x950-MAX`, 8 members) as at 2026-07-30 ✅ — re-verify before use:**

| Console | Member | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `u7` | 1 | Active Master at time of survey (bare banner) |
| `u5` | 2 | by elimination — a leftover session held it at `#`, so no banner |
| `u6` | 3 | |
| **`u8`** | **4** | |
| `u10` | 5 | |
| `u11` | 6 | |
| `u12` | 7 | |
| `u9` | 8 | |

> **Corrected 2026-07-30.** This table previously said member 4 had **no console** ("7 consoles for
> 8 members"). Wrong — member 4 is on **`/dev/u8`**, and all 8 members are reachable. The likely
> cause of the miss: the 2026-07-29 sweep ran around a member-reboot loop, and a **booting** unit's
> console emits boot spam rather than a `login:` banner, so `u8` fell into the no-banner bucket.
> **Sweep a quiescent stack**, or a rebooting member reads as an absent one.

Master ID is **not** stable: any failover or rolling reboot re-elects it, so re-read the banners
immediately before a run that targets "the master". The `.setup` slot labels (`c2_core_stk_4`)
are **not** stack IDs.

### Predicting which member becomes master ✅

From `ck.db`'s own CLI reference (`stack priority`, `stack_cmd/stack_priority_ag.html`): **the
lowest priority value wins; where two members share the lowest value, the lowest MAC address
wins.** Default is 128, and *"assigning a new priority value will not immediately change the
current stack master"* — election happens only on reboot, and there is no pre-emption when a
higher-priority unit rejoins.

On tb105, ID 1 is priority **10** and every other member is **128**, so:

| Reboot the master… | …and the new master is |
|---|---|
| ID 1 (priority 10) | **ID 8** — lowest MAC (`e01a.ea43.e462`) among the 128s |
| ID 8 | **ID 1** — priority 10 beats every 128 |

Confirmed on hardware twice on 2026-07-30, so a repeated master-reboot loop alternates **1 ↔ 8**.
Worth knowing before a run: it tells you which console will hold the master next.

### Backup consoles are RELAYED to the master ✅

Logging in on a *backup* member's console does not give you that unit — the Stack Login Server
relays the session to the master. Consequence when the master reboots: **every backup console
session is dropped**, with

```
Read from remote host node-1: Software caused connection abort
```

and the console falls back to its own `login:` banner. So the `has become the Active Master`
promotion message appears **only on the console of the unit that actually won the election** —
watching one arbitrary member and waiting for it is a coin flip. Work out who will win first
(priority, then lowest MAC, above), or sweep every member's banner.

**Interactive** 📄: `ssh tb105` → `u5` (minicom, 115200). Leave with `Ctrl-A Q`.

**Programmatic (recommended for scripted grounding)** 📄 — run this **on tb105** (the console
is local to tb105), driving `/dev/u5` directly with pyserial:

```python
# on tb105:  python3 drive.py
import serial, time
s = serial.Serial('/dev/u5', 115200, timeout=1)

def cmd(c, settle=0.4):
    s.write((c + '\r').encode()); time.sleep(settle)
    out = b''
    while True:
        chunk = s.read(4096)
        if not chunk: break
        out += chunk
        if b'--More--' in chunk:            # answer the pager with a space, no newline
            s.write(b' '); time.sleep(settle)
    return out.decode(errors='replace')

s.write(b'\r'); time.sleep(0.3); s.read(4096)   # wake the console, clear banner
cmd('terminal length 0')                        # session-scoped: disable the pager
print(cmd('show interface port1.0.1'))          # read-only 'show' commands only
s.close()
```

**Discipline** 📄: read-only `show` commands, session-scoped `terminal length 0`, leave
nothing on the box. This is how the CLI-grounding session captured real `show interface`
output (`current duplex full, current speed 1000, current polarity mdix`).

## 2a. Reading a bench's real state — MOVED

Driver guidance now lives in **orient §3**, which owns it: which of the two console drivers to
use, the six binding traps (`console.mode('#')` first, framework credentials not the `.setup`'s,
`powerOn=False`, `Stack.members` is an unordered set, baud from `[baudrates]`, `setup.log`
ownership), and the measured `terminal monitor` boundary between them.

Canonical read-only probe: `ask-ck/test-composer/bench_probe.py`. Cabling-discovery *method*
(LACP partner system-ID, MAC table from both ends, and why link state alone proves nothing) and
its results are recorded in `bench-state.md` §8 alongside the evidence for each line.

The one thing worth repeating here, because it is an *access* fact: **a console held by another
operator** (`/var/lock/LCK..*`, `pgrep minicom`, `fuser -v /dev/uN`) must be reported as
*unknown*, never as *absent* — tb470's `/dev/u0` was locked once and the x230 read as unmapped
until it was freed.

## 3. Run an ATTestSet framework test script on a testbox 🔧

This is the mechanism `pt_exec.py` (`_connect` / `RunManager._run`) uses for a PyTest
Creator hardware run.

> ✅ **The server-side run path is now VERIFIED end to end (2026-08-03).**
> `POST /api/pytest-create/profiles/tb470/check` returns
> `{"ok":true,"ssh":true,"framework":true,"sudo":true,"detail":"tb470\nPython 3.13.5"}`.
> It had never passed before, for a reason that had nothing to do with the lab: **`paramiko`
> was declared in no requirements file**, and because `import paramiko` sits inside
> `_connect()`, the probe answered `"SSH connection failed: No module named 'paramiko'"` —
> which reads as a testbox or network fault. See §3a for the two settings it needs.

**Preconditions on the box:** `/home/st-art/framework` present (READ-ONLY — never write under
it), passwordless `sudo`, `python3`. `check_profile()` probes exactly these.

**Steps (mirroring `RunManager._run`):**

```bash
sock=/run/user/1971/keyring/ssh
BOX=st-art@<testbox>                         # profile default user is st-art, key auth
WORK=/home/st-art/pytest-create/<CASE_KEY>/<RUN_ID>

SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$sock ssh "$BOX" "mkdir -p $WORK"
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$sock scp <script>.py <lib>.py <topology>.setup "$BOX:$WORK/"
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$sock ssh "$BOX" "
  cd $WORK && ln -sfn /home/st-art/framework framework &&
  sudo -n PYTHONPATH=/home/st-art python3 ./<script>.py -s <topology>.setup -v
"
```

- The `-s <…>.setup` argument names the topology file (`SETUP-FILE-REFERENCE.md`); the
  script binds device roles from it (`init_swi('swi_a')`, `init_portlink(...)`) and never
  hardcodes a port.
- Results are the framework's stdout; `pt_exec.parse_framework_log()` turns it into
  per-TestCase PASS/FAIL. On a hang (e.g. a physical step waiting on an operator) keep the
  partial output — do not discard completed TestCases.
- **Framework read-only guard:** never redirect/`cp`/`rsync`/interpret into
  `/home/st-art/framework`; copy any file you must edit into the run workdir first
  (`_assert_write_allowed` / `_assert_command_allowed` enforce this in the tool).

### 3a. The two things a server-side run needs that are easy to miss ✅

Both verified 2026-08-03 on tb470.

**1. The profile user is `terrenceb`, NOT the `st-art` default.** `st-art@tb470` does *not*
authenticate with the keyring key — `Permission denied (publickey,password)`. `terrenceb@tb470`
does, and it has passwordless `sudo` and `python3` 3.13.5, and can read
`/home/st-art/framework`. So the profile must set `user` explicitly:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/pytest-create/profiles -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "name":"tb470","tb_number":"470","host":"tb470","user":"terrenceb","auth":"key",
  "setups":{"tb470":"/home/st-art/st-art/configs/tb470.setup"}}'
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/api/pytest-create/profiles/tb470/check
```

**2. The SERVER process needs the keyring agent, not just your shell.** `pt_exec._connect`
falls back to `key_path` (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`, passphrase-encrypted and useless
non-interactively) and otherwise relies on paramiko's agent support — i.e. on the *uvicorn
process's* `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`. Started from VS Code it inherits the forwarded **Mac** agent, which
is empty. Export the keyring socket before restarting; `run.sh` passes the environment through:

```bash
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-/run/user/1971}/keyring/ssh"
ssh-add -l                            # must list the RSA key
./ask-ck/CK-main/run.sh --restart
```

⚠️ `run.sh` **always** passes `--reload`, so editing anything under `ask-ck/CK-main` bounces the
server and kills in-flight LLM calls. Sequence server-code edits into idle windows during a long
batch — this cost a mid-run case here.

> Note: tb105 fronts a switch **console** (§2); a framework run needs a testbox whose
> `.setup` declares real `tb-` portlinks to the DUT(s). tb105's `kochi_uni_tb105.setup`
> declares **zero** `tb-` portlinks (no data-plane cabling), so it is a CLI-console box, not
> a data-plane run target. 📄
>
> **Refined 2026-07-29** ✅: that holds for *data-plane* runs only. **Console-only scripts run
> fine on tb105** — a script that just drives the master console (stack reboot/failover loops,
> CLI grounding) needs no portlinks at all, and several were executed there successfully. The
> distinction is portlinks, not "can't run scripts here". Also note tb105 runs as user
> `terrenceb`, not `st-art`, and needs no `sudo` for serial access.

---

## 4. Running a LEGACY corpus script on hardware ✅

Corpus scripts recovered from `ck.db` are mostly 2015-era and **will not run as-is** against the
current framework. Verified 2026-07-29 staging three stack-reboot scripts onto tb105.

### Never patch the source of truth

**`ck.db` and `/home/st-art/framework` are both off-limits for edits** — Terrence: "explicitly
bad things". The workflow is:

1. Extract `scripts.source_text` from `ck.db` (read-only; `sqlite3 'file:…ck.db?mode=ro'`).
2. Verify what you extracted against the stored `scripts.sha1` — the DB holds the whole literal
   file body, so this should match exactly.
3. Write it to a **staging copy**, keep a `.orig` beside it, and patch only the copy.
4. Staging at the **root of testbox_home works with no SCP step** — that path *is*
   `/home/terrenceb` on the testbox over NFS (`10.36.250.11:/home`). Note this is a *shared* lab
   home, not private scratch.

### The four breakages, in the order they bite

| # | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` importing the framework under `python` | **The framework is Python 3 ONLY** (`ATSwitch.py` uses f-strings). Testboxes still ship `python` 2.7 — use `python3` with `PYTHONPATH=/home/st-art`. This then *forces* fixes 2-4. |
| 2 | `AttributeError: 'dict' has no attribute 'iteritems'` | py2-only, and usually inside an arg-logging helper called *before* the main loop, so it dies instantly. → `.items()`. |
| 3 | `AttributeError: can't set attribute` on `dut.name = …` | **`Switch.name` is now a read-only `@property`** (returns `mappedName or setupName`). Assign the underlying attrs: `obj.mappedName = None; obj.setupName = …`. `Switch.name_is()` is a *comparison*, not a setter. |
| 4 | Console won't open, or `TypeError: %d format` | **TBv4 wants a full device path.** A testbox with `/etc/network/interfaces` is TBv4, where `Switch(tty=…)` needs `/dev/u5`, not an int — so `add_argument("device", type=int)` cannot express it. Knock-on: any `'%d' % tty` filename then `TypeError`s, and a raw path in a filename needs its basename. |

Only `name` and `bootsFromFlash` are read-only properties on `Switch`; `logFileName`,
`console.logFileName`, `preCmdBuf` and `preModeBuf` are all still plain attributes. Check the
whole set of attributes a script assigns *before* launching, rather than crash-and-retry.

### Also check: mis-calibrated timeouts, and unexpected config writes

- **Timeouts were tuned for flash-booting units.** tb105's x950 stack **netboots via TFTP**
  (`tftp://10.37.105.100/x950-tb105.rel`, with a bootloader *"forced to boot from a non-standard
  location"* warning). Measured: **5 m 44 s for ONE unit** to reach `Configuration update
  completed`; **6 m 49 s for 7 members rebooted concurrently**. A shipped 300 s stack-reform
  budget is therefore shorter than a single unit's boot and fails spuriously — raise it and say so
  in the log.
- **Several of these scripts write startup-config.** They check for
  `line con 0 / exec-timeout 0 0 / length 0` in `show run` and, if absent, enter config mode and
  `wr`. Read `show running-config | include line|exec-timeout|length` first; if it is already
  present the branch never fires and the DUT config is untouched.

### Worked example — console-only run on tb105

```bash
sock=/run/user/1971/keyring/ssh
# cwd holds the framework's per-device console logs; logDir gets the script's own run log
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$sock ssh tb105 '
  cd ~/x950-reboot-run &&
  setsid nohup env PYTHONPATH=/home/st-art python3 ~/<script>.py -v \
      <args> /home/terrenceb/ > run.stdout 2>&1 < /dev/null &'
```

- `setsid nohup … < /dev/null &` so the run survives the SSH session closing. These loops run for
  hours; poll the log rather than holding a connection open.
- **Python buffers stdout when redirected**, so `run.stdout` stays *empty* until the process
  exits. Read the script's own log file for live progress, and the framework's
  `<hostname>.log` for the raw console transcript.
- Framework logs are written with `\r` line endings and embedded NULs — `tr -d '\000'` before
  `grep`, or grep reports "binary file matches".
- **Never `pkill -f <script-name>` over SSH**: the pattern matches the remote `bash -c` command
  line carrying it and kills your own session (exit 255). Use `pgrep -f "[s]cript"` to test, and
  kill by the PID you captured.


## 4a / 4b. MOVED

- **§4a, de-stacking and split-stack lessons** → **orient §6**, which now carries the split
  signature (`Disabled Master`, `Operating in failover mode`, each unit seeing the other as
  `Provisioned`, 26 ports `err-disable`), both causes and their opposite fixes, the recovery
  sequence, the ⛔ on `no stack <id> enable`, and the fact that a rejoin does not re-elect.
  Product facts from it (media-blind CLI, "absence from the docs means UNKNOWN") are in
  orient §2.
- **§4b, tb470 host networking** → **`TB470-HOST-NETWORKING.md`**. It was never about access.
